**Private Image Annotator:** A secure image annotation solution was required that didn't transmit the image files(private medical images) off premises, so I built this to achieve the desired result.

To run this program do the following:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your device
2. Use the following command inside the Private Image Annotator directory from the command line `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program from the command line `python Image Annotator.py`

**Surgical Tool - Object Detection:** A comprehensive object detection was built to showcase when a surgical tool enters the image.

**Surgery Images - Temporal Ordering:** This project utilizes a Siamese architecture to take two images and then predict which image happened first within a given surgery.
